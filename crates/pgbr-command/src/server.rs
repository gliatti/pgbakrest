//! Server commands: `server`, `server-ping`.
//!
//! C reference: `src/command/server/server.c` and
//! `src/command/server/ping.c`.
//!
//! The real pgBackRest `server` command binds a TLS listener on a TCP
//! socket and serves the local/remote JSON-line protocol to each remote
//! pgBackRest process that connects; `server-ping` is the client that
//! connects and issues a no-op to confirm the server is alive.
//!
//! The transport-agnostic *protocol* core both commands drive lives here:
//!
//! - [`serve`] — the request/response loop a server runs per connection.
//! - [`ping_exchange`] — the single no-op round trip the ping client does.
//!
//! Both operate over any [`IoRead`] / [`IoWrite`] pair, so they are tested
//! over in-memory [`MemRead`](pgbr_io::MemRead) /
//! [`MemWrite`](pgbr_io::MemWrite) streams.
//!
//! On top of those cores this module supplies two transports:
//!
//! **Plain TCP** (no encryption):
//!
//! - [`TcpIo`] adapts a [`std::net::TcpStream`] to [`IoRead`] / [`IoWrite`].
//! - [`serve_listener`] / [`serve_tcp`] accept connections and run [`serve`]
//!   per connection; [`ping_tcp`] connects and runs [`ping_exchange`].
//!
//! **TLS** (matching the real pgBackRest, C reference `src/common/io/tls/`):
//!
//! - [`TlsIo`] adapts a [`rustls`] stream ([`rustls::StreamOwned`] over a
//!   [`TcpStream`], server or client side) to [`IoRead`] / [`IoWrite`] — the
//!   same shape as [`TcpIo`], since a `rustls` stream is also a single
//!   bidirectional `Read`/`Write` handle.
//! - [`serve_tls`] accepts a TCP connection, runs the rustls **server**
//!   handshake from a cert chain + private key, then drives [`serve`].
//! - [`ping_tls`] connects, runs the rustls **client** handshake trusting a
//!   configured CA, then drives [`ping_exchange`].
//!
//! Because [`serve`] and [`ping_exchange`] are transport-agnostic, the TLS
//! path reuses them unchanged — only the byte transport differs.
//!
//! The user-facing [`server`] and [`ping`] entry points read the bind /
//! connect address from the configured `tls-server-address` /
//! `tls-server-port` options (defaulting to `127.0.0.1:8432`) and select the
//! transport from the configured TLS options:
//!
//! - [`server`] uses TLS when `tls-server-cert-file` **and**
//!   `tls-server-key-file` are configured (loading PEM via `rustls-pemfile`),
//!   otherwise falls back to plain TCP.
//! - [`ping`] uses TLS when a CA file (`tls-server-ca-file`) is configured,
//!   otherwise falls back to plain TCP.
