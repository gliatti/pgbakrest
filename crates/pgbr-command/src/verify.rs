//! `verify` command — confirm whole-repository integrity.
//!
//! C reference: `src/command/verify/verify.c` (+ `src/command/verify/file.c`).
//! `verify` walks the repository and reports every integrity problem it finds
//! rather than aborting on the first. The pass has three stages, mirroring the
//! C `verifyProcess`:
//!
//! 1. **Info-file consistency.** Load `backup/<stanza>/backup.info` and
//!    `archive/<stanza>/archive.info` and confirm they describe the same
//!    cluster: the active database identity (`db-id` / `db-system-id` /
//!    `db-version`) and the `[db:history]` lists must agree. C ref:
//!    `verifyPgHistory`. (A missing `archive.info` is tolerated — a repo can
//!    legitimately hold only backups — and recorded as an informational
//!    problem rather than aborting.)
//! 2. **Backup files.** For every backup in `[backup:current]` (or just the
//!    `--set` backup), load its `backup.manifest` and re-read every
//!    checksummed file, recomputing its SHA-1 and comparing to the recorded
//!    value. A file whose manifest entry carries a `reference` is read from the
//!    backup that physically holds its bytes
//!    (`backup/<stanza>/<reference>/<path>`), exactly as restore resolves
//!    differential / incremental references. Missing files and size mismatches
//!    are detected too. C ref: `verifyFile`.
//! 3. **WAL archive.** Walk `archive/<stanza>/` and verify every WAL segment.
//!    The C implementation lays archives out as
//!    `archive/<archive-id>/<wal-path>/<segment>-<sha1>` and verifies the
//!    SHA-1 encoded in the filename; this fork currently writes a **flat**
//!    `archive/<stanza>/<segment>` layout with no checksum in the name (see
//!    `archive.rs`). So when a segment filename carries a `-<40-hex>` suffix
//!    its embedded checksum is verified; otherwise the segment is verified for
//!    presence + readability and the missing-checksum gap is recorded as a
//!    note on the result.
//!
//! Corruption is **collected, not thrown**: a verify run that finds damage
//! still completes and reports every problem it found. [`verify_inner`] always
//! returns a [`VerifyReport`]; only structural failures — an absent
//! `--stanza`, an unreadable / malformed `backup.info`, or an unreadable
//! `backup.manifest` — bubble up as a [`CommandError`].
