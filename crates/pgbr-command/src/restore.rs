//! `restore` command — copy a backup into a PG data directory.
//!
//! C reference: `src/command/restore/restore.c`. This slice re-creates every
//! directory the manifest records, then for every captured file reads it from
//! the repository's flat backup layout
//! (`backup/<stanza>/<label>/<file.path><suffix>`), reverses the backup's
//! [`RepoTransform`] (decrypt then decompress), writes the recovered plaintext
//! to the PG target, and verifies its SHA-1 (via the [`pgbr_io::Sha1`] filter)
//! against the value recorded in the manifest. Because the manifest records
//! the *plaintext* checksum, that single check validates the whole
//! compress -> encrypt -> decrypt -> decompress round trip.
//!
//! The transform is read from the backup's recorded `backup.info` metadata
//! (compress-type + encrypted flag), so restore reverses exactly what the
//! backup applied — independent of the restore command's own compress/cipher
//! options. The cipher *password* is never stored in the repo, so it is sourced
//! from the resolved options. When the metadata is absent (e.g. an older
//! backup), the transform falls back to the resolved options.
//!
//! Backup selection:
//!
//! - `--set <label>` restores that specific backup; an unknown label (not in
//!   `backup/<stanza>/backup.info`'s `[backup:current]` block) is a
//!   [`CommandError::Other`].
//! - Without `--set`, the lexicographically-greatest label in
//!   `[backup:current]` is restored — pgBackRest labels sort chronologically
//!   (`YYYYMMDD-HHMMSSF…`), so the greatest label is the latest backup. An
//!   empty `[backup:current]` is a [`CommandError::Other`].
//!
//! Checksum verification is **on** and a mismatch is a **hard error**
//! ([`CommandError::Other`]): restoring corrupt data silently is worse than
//! failing the restore.
//!
//! # Parallel file copy (`process-max`)
//!
//! The per-file work — read the repo file, reverse its [`RepoTransform`]
//! (decrypt then decompress), write the recovered plaintext to the PG target,
//! and verify its SHA-1 — is distributed across `process-max` workers via the
//! in-process [`pgbr_protocol::parallel`] dispatcher, mirroring `backup`. All
//! the decision logic (backup selection, reference resolution, db-include /
//! db-exclude filtering, delta matching, tablespace-target resolution, symlink
//! re-creation, recovery config) stays on the main thread; only the actual
//! file copies are dispatched. The [`Storage`] trait is not `Send`, so each job
//! threads owned absolute [`PathBuf`]s plus a cloned [`RepoTransform`] into the
//! worker, which does its I/O via `std::fs` against those absolute paths (the
//! same pattern `backup` uses). The hard-fail SHA-1 check runs **per file in
//! the worker**, so a corrupt file fails the whole restore regardless of which
//! worker copied it. `process-max=1` reproduces the prior serial behaviour
//! byte-for-byte. C reference: `src/protocol/parallel.c`.
//!
//! # Manifest references (differential restore)
//!
//! A differential backup records files unchanged since its base full backup
//! with `reference: Some(<full label>)` instead of re-copying their bytes. When
//! restore encounters such a file it reads the bytes from the *referenced*
//! backup's directory (`backup/<stanza>/<reference label>/<path><suffix>`)
//! rather than the restored backup's own dir. The referenced backup's transform
//! (compress / cipher) is read from its own `[backup:current]` entry in
//! `backup.info`, so each file is reversed with exactly the transform it was
//! written under. The final plaintext is SHA-1-checked the same way regardless
//! of which backup supplied the bytes. Files with `reference: None` restore from
//! the restored backup's own dir, exactly as before.
//!
//! # Delta restore (`--delta`)
//!
//! When `--delta` is set, each manifest file is checked against what is already
//! on the PG target *before* copying: if the target file exists with the same
//! size and (when the manifest records one) the same SHA-1, the copy is skipped
//! and counted in [`RestoreOutcome::files_skipped`]. Mismatched or missing files
//! are restored exactly as in a non-delta restore. Without `--delta`, every
//! manifest file is copied (the prior behaviour, unchanged).
//!
//! Delta restore also removes target files that are **not** present in the
//! manifest so the target ends up matching the backup exactly. After the copy
//! pass, the PG target is walked recursively and any regular file whose
//! manifest-relative path is absent from the manifest's `[target:file]` set is
//! removed (counted in [`RestoreOutcome::files_removed`]). Empty directories are
//! left alone — directory reconciliation is still deferred.
//!
//! # Symlink re-creation
//!
//! Every `[target:link]` entry is re-created as a real symlink in the PG target
//! pointing at its recorded destination, via [`pgbr_storage::Storage::create_symlink`].
//! On the [`pgbr_storage::Posix`] backend this is a `std::os::unix::fs::symlink`;
//! backends that do not support symlinks return the trait's default
//! "unsupported" error and the link is counted in [`RestoreOutcome::skipped_links`]
//! instead. Successful re-creations are counted in [`RestoreOutcome::links_created`].
//!
//! # Tablespace remapping
//!
//! A tablespace is stored under `pg_tblspc/<oid>` as a symlink whose recorded
//! destination is the external path the tablespace lived at. On restore, the
//! destination of every `pg_tblspc/<oid>` link can be redirected:
//!
//! - `--tablespace-map=<oid>=<path>` remaps one specific tablespace's
//!   destination directory.
//! - `--tablespace-map-all=<prefix>` puts *every* tablespace under
//!   `<prefix>/<tablespace-name>`, where the name is the last path component of
//!   the link's recorded destination.
//!
//! Precedence is explicit `--tablespace-map` entry > `--tablespace-map-all`
//! prefix > the manifest's recorded destination. The pure
//! [`resolve_tablespace_target`] function does the resolution and is wired into
//! the symlink-creation path. Links that are not tablespace links
//! (`pg_tblspc/<oid>`) keep their recorded destination unchanged.
//!
//! # Generic link remapping (`--link-map`)
//!
//! A non-tablespace symlink (e.g. `pg_wal`) can be re-created pointing at a
//! different destination via `--link-map=<link-name>=<path>`, where `<link-name>`
//! is the link's path relative to the PG data dir (the manifest link name with its
//! `pg_data/` prefix stripped). When a manifest link's name has a `--link-map`
//! entry, the link is created at the mapped destination instead of the manifest's
//! recorded target; unmapped links keep their recorded target. The pure
//! [`resolve_link_target`] function does the resolution. Tablespace links are
//! never subject to `--link-map` (they are remapped only via `--tablespace-map` /
//! `--tablespace-map-all`), matching the C generator, which errors if a tablespace
//! is named in `--link-map`. C ref: the link-remap loop in
//! `src/command/restore/remap.c.inc`.
//!
//! # Selective database restore (`--db-include` / `--db-exclude`)
//!
//! `--db-include` restores ONLY the named databases; `--db-exclude` restores all
//! databases EXCEPT the named ones. The two are mutually exclusive (supplying
//! both is a [`CommandError::Other`]). A database's files live under
//! `base/<db-oid>/` and, for tablespace-resident databases, under
//! `pg_tblspc/<ts>/PG_*/<db-oid>/`. The [`database_included`] predicate extracts
//! the db-oid from such paths and applies the include/exclude lists; files that
//! are not under any database directory (`global/`, `pg_wal/`, top-level config
//! files, etc.) are ALWAYS restored. Excluded files are simply not copied.
//!
//! # Recovery configuration
//!
//! After the file copy, restore writes the version-appropriate recovery
//! configuration so `PostgreSQL` knows how to fetch WAL and where to stop. The
//! split is keyed on the manifest's `db_version`:
//!
//! - **PG < 12** — a `recovery.conf` is written into the PG data dir.
//! - **PG >= 12** — the recovery block is appended to `postgresql.auto.conf`
//!   (existing contents preserved) and a `recovery.signal` file is created
//!   (or `standby.signal` for `--type=standby`).
//!
//! The block always contains the `restore_command` `PostgreSQL` runs to fetch an
//! archived WAL segment, plus the resolved recovery-target type: `--type=immediate`
//! adds `recovery_target = 'immediate'`; `--type=standby` adds `standby_mode = 'on'`
//! on PG < 12 (PG >= 12 relies on the `standby.signal` file); `--type=time|name|lsn|xid`
//! emit `recovery_target_<type> = '<--target value>'` (with `recovery_target_inclusive
//! = 'false'` when `--target-exclusive` is set for time/lsn/xid); `--type=default`
//! (or unset) writes only the `restore_command`. `--type=none` writes no recovery
//! files at all.
//!
//! On top of the target type, the recovery-target family is honoured:
//!
//! - `--target-action` (`pause` / `promote` / `shutdown`) emits
//!   `recovery_target_action = '<value>'` whenever the resolved value is not the
//!   default `pause` (matching the C generator, which suppresses the GUC for the
//!   default since `PostgreSQL` already pauses).
//! - `--target-timeline` emits `recovery_target_timeline = '<value>'`. On PG < 12
//!   the literal value `current` is *not* written (that version defaults to it and
//!   rejects it as an explicit parameter); on PG >= 12 it is always written. When
//!   `--target-timeline` is unset, `--type=immediate` on PG >= 12 still emits
//!   `recovery_target_timeline = 'current'` so recovery does not chase the latest
//!   timeline it cannot reach (mirrors the C workaround for a `PostgreSQL` bug).
//!
//! On top of the built-in lines, `--recovery-option=<key>=<value>` (a `Hash`
//! option) writes arbitrary extra recovery settings verbatim into the generated
//! config (e.g. `archive_cleanup_command=...`, a `restore_command=...` override,
//! `primary_conninfo=...`). The user options are merged in AFTER the built-in
//! recovery-target lines, so a user key that collides with a built-in (notably
//! `restore_command`) wins: the built-in line is suppressed and the user value
//! emitted instead. Keys arrive `-`-separated (users naturally type pgBackRest's
//! own option style) and are normalised to `_` before writing; values are
//! single-quoted, matching the recovery-conf `key = 'value'` format. C ref:
//! `restoreRecoveryOption` in `src/command/restore/config.c.inc`.
//!
//! The generator is the pure [`recovery_files`] function so it is unit-testable
//! without any storage.
//!
//! # Deferred to later commits
//!
//! - `--type=preserve` (leave any existing recovery file untouched). The resolved
//!   recovery-target settings (`--type`, `--target`, `--target-exclusive`,
//!   `--target-action`, `--target-timeline`) plus arbitrary `--recovery-option`
//!   passthrough are generated here.
//!
//! This is the full raw-restore path; everything above is genuinely out of
//! scope for the slice, not silently dropped.
