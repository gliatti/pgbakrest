//! `Storage` over a spawned `pgbackrest` worker, for inter-host operation.
//!
//! Mirrors the caller side of the C `src/storage/remote/storage.c` +
//! `src/protocol/helper.c` pair: when `repo-host` / `pg-host` is set, the main
//! process does not touch the remote resource directly. It spawns a subordinate
//! `pgbackrest` worker (over SSH for a remote host, or the binary itself for a
//! local worker) and proxies every [`Storage`] call to it over the JSON-line
//! protocol from [`pgbr_protocol`].
//!
//! The three building blocks already exist:
//!
//! - [`pgbr_protocol::ProcessClient`] spawns the child and owns the [`Child`]
//!   plus a [`ProtocolClient`] over its piped stdin/stdout.
//! - [`pgbr_storage::remote::RemoteStorage`] implements [`Storage`] by issuing
//!   one protocol request per method through a [`ProtocolClient`].
//! - the spawned `pgbackrest` runs [`pgbr_command::worker::run_worker_stdio`]
//!   (wired in [`crate::run_with_context`]) to answer the protocol on its
//!   stdio.
//!
//! The API-fit problem this module solves: [`RemoteStorage::new`] wants a
//! [`ProtocolClient`], but [`ProcessClient`] owns *both* the child and the
//! client — and the child must outlive the proxy or its stdin/stdout pipes are
//! torn down, hanging the worker. [`RemoteProcessStorage`] holds the [`Child`]
//! alongside the [`RemoteStorage`] built over the same pipes, delegating the
//! [`Storage`] trait to the inner proxy and reaping the worker on [`Drop`].
