//! `backup.manifest` reader / writer.
//!
//! `backup.manifest` lives at the root of a backup directory and is the per-backup
//! inventory: every file, path, and symlink captured by the backup, each with its
//! size / timestamp / checksum metadata. It is the largest of the on-disk info files,
//! but shares the exact same SHA-1-checksummed INI envelope as `archive.info` and
//! `backup.info` (see [`crate::format`]). Mirrors `src/info/manifest.{c,h}` in the C tree.
//!
//! The on-disk layout, trimmed to the parts this slice models:
//!
//! ```text
//! [backup]
//! backup-label="20240101-120000F"
//! backup-timestamp-start=1704110400
//! backup-timestamp-stop=1704110410
//! backup-type="full"
//!
//! [backup:db]
//! db-system-id=6873049345984568091
//! db-version="14"
//!
//! [target:file]
//! pg_data/PG_VERSION={"size":3,"timestamp":1704110400,"checksum":"<sha1>"}
//!
//! [target:link]
//! pg_data/pg_wal={"destination":"/var/lib/pg_wal"}
//!
//! [target:path]
//! pg_data={}
//!
//! [backrest]
//! backrest-checksum="..."
//! backrest-format=5
//! backrest-version="2.58"
//! ```
//!
//! # Simplification
//!
//! The C side shrinks large manifests by hoisting the most common per-entry values into
//! `[target:file:default]` / `[target:path:default]` / `[target:link:default]` sections
//! and recording only the deltas in each entry. This first slice does **not** implement
//! that default-deduplication optimisation: every `[target:file]` / `[target:path]` /
//! `[target:link]` entry is stored verbatim as a full JSON value. The `*:default`
//! sections are neither read nor written.
