//! In-memory log capture sink used by the in-crate `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` blocks
//! across the workspace.
//!
//! When [`is_installed`] is true, [`super::format::log_post`] routes the file sink (the
//! `level_file` channel) to [`append`] instead of `write(2)`. Test code reads the

//!
//! Threading model is the same single-threaded fork-per-process invariant as the rest of
