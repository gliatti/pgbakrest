# Reset the principal PostgreSQL cluster to a clean, running baseline.
#
# The backup→restore validation stops the cluster, restores into its data dir,
# and restarts it. A run that fails mid-restore (or any earlier bug) can leave
# the data dir in a half-restored, non-bootable state — which then breaks every
# subsequent run because the harness assumes a live server. This script makes
# the validation idempotent: it tears the cluster down, re-initdbs it, rewrites
# the KB postgresql.conf knobs (port 5433, archiving wired to pgbackrest), and
# starts it. Run as root (it uses `sudo -u postgres` internally).

# Stop systemd-logind from reaping the postgres user's POSIX IPC. The cluster is
# started via `sudo -u postgres pg_ctl`, so its DSM control segment under
# /dev/shm/PostgreSQL.* is owned by the postgres uid. With the systemd default
# RemoveIPC=yes (and no lingering user manager), logind removes all postgres-owned
# shared-memory segments the moment the last postgres login session closes — which
# happens constantly as the harness opens/closes `sudo -u postgres` sessions. The
# running postmaster then survives but every NEW backend dies with
#   FATAL: could not open shared memory segment "/PostgreSQL.<id>": No such file
# (seen as a pgbackrest "db-open" failure / hang on the pull-backup path). Enabling
# linger + RemoveIPC=no makes the segments persistent for the cluster's lifetime.

# its own version's pg_ctl, -m immediate so a stuck recovery cannot block us.
